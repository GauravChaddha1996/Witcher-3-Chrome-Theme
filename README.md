# Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt Chrome Theme
This theme was born out of boredom and an awesome wallpaper found on deviantart.com. Here's the [link](http://fav.me/d7wgxb8) for the wallpaper.

I'll recommend installing this theme alongside [popsicle](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/popsicle/loigpbgkmjjhjodnhlpmbjmojchpdjih) 
a new tab extension and customize it to hide useless stuff.

## Installing the theme 
Clone this repo on your computer. Now go to chrome and type "chrome://extensions/" in your address bar and then press load unpacked extension button. Now select the repo on your local machine and voila - the theme is now installed.
I'm also providing the crx file in case somebody needs it.
